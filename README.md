Quantified Asset Management Options is a free multi-market, multi-asset data analyzer. In the first phase, it would study the Tehran stock exchange. Then it would cover the cryptocurrency market, gold, and global markets.

## Notice
QAMO is an offspring of previous projects I conducted individually in the past. In the first phase, it would manage to rerun the previously written code. However, I will improve its reusability, maintenance, and development. 

## Disclaimer
QAMO is for personal use, and it does not certify any results. Please don't use the results. I renounce any financial inference or trading outcomes you might have based on QAMO's results.
